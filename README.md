# :soccer: FootyLinks :soccer: 

This web app was inspired by my [previous project](https://github.com/jctissier/Euro2016_TerminalApp)

FootyLinks is a web app that scrapes football content in real time, such as:

* High quality match highlights (Remove as many ads as possible)
* Links for any live match streams
* Lots of stats: Fixtures, standings, topscorers...

Built with Python/Flask, hosted on Heroku (Free Tier!)

No logins or emails required and there will **never** be Ad! Just a fun side project that I needed to fix those football cravings without the headache of clicking through multiple websites ðŸ˜€.
