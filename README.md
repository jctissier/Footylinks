# :soccer: FootyLinks :soccer: 

[Inspired by a previous project](https://github.com/jctissier/Euro2016_TerminalApp)

FootyLinks is a web app that scrapes football (soccer) content in real time:

* High quality match highlights (0 ads most of the time - removed as many as possible)
* Links for any live match streams
* Lots of stats: Fixtures, standings, topscorers...

No logins or emails required and there will **never** be Ads! Just a fun side project that I really needed to fix those football cravings without the headache of clicking through multiple websites ðŸ˜€.
